# Drink-Mixology Web Application
Welcome to my new project. Drink Mixology is a fun and interactive web application designed for cocktail enthusiasts and bartenders alike.


## About this project
With Drink Mixology, users can explore the world of mixology by inputting the name of their favorite alcoholic drink. The application then provides a delightful surprise by presenting a random cocktail recipe based on the selected alcoholic drink. Each cocktail comes complete with an enticing image and detailed instructions on how to prepare it.


## Key Features
- Random Cocktail Generation: Discover new and exciting cocktail recipes by entering the name of your preferred alcoholic drink.
- Vivid Visuals: Enjoy a visually appealing experience with enticing images of each cocktail.
- Step-by-Step Instructions: Each cocktail recipe comes with clear and concise instructions, making it easy for users to recreate the drinks at home or behind the bar.
